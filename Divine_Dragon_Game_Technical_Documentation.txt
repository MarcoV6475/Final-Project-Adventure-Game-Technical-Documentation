=== Divine Dragon Game: Technical Documentation ===


= Product Overview: =
To begin, a brief summary of the game, the story takes place when the player gets 
in a battle againts a monster known as a Abomination. The player must defeat it 
with the help of a mysterious Goddess and explore the Kingdom of Tenrou where 
Dragon kin live. In this adventure, the player will go through challenges, 
hardships, and ultimatelty figure out the truth behind themselves and the Kingdom 
of Tenrou. The player will follow the plot of the story by communicating with 
Non-playable characters (npcs), will get asked questions, fight bosses, and have 
to make morraly difficult decisions.


= Product Objectives: =
This program is meant to be used as a game; although it is far from being a 
"completed game," this offers a skeleton of how to formulate the Divine Dragon 
Game. The way this game is designed is the player gets asked various questions 
they must then answer them; they will learn various things about the Kingdom of 
Tenrou and about their true selfs. 


= Where is the Code Hosted: =
The program is all python code and can be hosted in the same zipped file this 
Technical Document and on GitHub. In the GitHub website there you can find the 
entire code split into multiple chapters and has multiple functions. 


= External Services: =
The python code was msotly worked on Python Idle; in the file there is a Main Game
file that you can run the game in. In there I have imported the various chapters 
in the Divine Cragon Game along with a gvars2 file.  


= Language and Technologies: =
As mentioned previously this Divine Dragon Game is made through 100% python code. 
In the code I imported various chapters and modules to be used in my game. 


= System Requirements and Supported Applications: =
This program requires multiple files, it will need the following: Main_Game_File,
gvars2 file, and Chapter1-5. This can be used in pycharm, run on python idle, or 
can be used in GitHub as well. 


= Coding/Naming Conventions: =
Inside the Divine Dragon game I leave comments throughout the program to give more
insights into the story. For example, I have multiple comments that list the intro
of a chapter or has a comment listing where the player is in the story. 


= How to Run/Build/Deploy the Program:=
In the Divine Dragon Game I built it with various python functionality I used the 
following: import statements, def fucntions, while statements, if else statements,
for loops, and print statements. In further detail, the "Main_Game_File" has 
listed various imported chapters and the gvars2 file. Each chapter has a print 
statements telling the intro to each chapter, next in the code there would be 
multiple def fucntions or for loops throughout the chapters. In this python code
for each functions that I have I have also called the fucntion right below it;
because it will call the fucntion and proceeding with the code. The Divine Dragon
Game can be run and deployed by simply accesing the "Main_Game_File" and running
the program from there; then it will import the rest of the chapter files
and you can find these files on my GitHub. 

= Overview of the Architecture: =
The python code is started with the user playing the game. Next, the code inside
the previously mentioned files are being called. Continuing, the code will take the
inputs form the user and continue to follow through the game as it was program.
After, the code will be imported ot the "Main_Game_File" and the user will keep 
playing until they have reached the end and reciece the Game Ended line. 


= How to start the Program: =
The Divine Dragon Game can be used in multiple platforms and the to run the program
is easy. The palyer must run the Program in the, "Main_Game_File" and the first 
thing to do is input a player name, and as soon as that is completed the rest of
the chapters will be imported. That is when you are launched into the Divine 
Dragon Game. Please Enjoy!
