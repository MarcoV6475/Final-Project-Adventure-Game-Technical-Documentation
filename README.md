# Final-Project-Adventure-Game-Technical-Documentation
This is Modules 10 our last assignment. In here I am posting the final versions of my adventure game titled, "Divine Dragon Game." I changed a lot of things thanks to the feedback I received; I hope you enjoy this game and know that although I struggled countless times with python I persevered through the end. Next, I have also added the Technical Documentation for the game as well.  
To access the game please go to the file called, "Main_Game_File" in there, you can run the program and the game will start playing. Please make sure to also get the rest of the files so the game can import all files and run the game properly. I hope you enjoy The Divine Dragon Game!
